title: Ethical aspects of Code Review
---

## Preparing for review
- Explain in details **what patch does** and in which context.
- Explain the **history** of the patch, if it matters.
- Tell how the patch was **tested** with *exact* commands.

## Preparing suggestions
- Think twice before setting suggestion's **severity**.
- By default, consider that the engineer makes educated decisions.
- Teach only *supervised* engineers, not anyone else.
- **Don't** ask rhetorical questions.
- Job titles **do not** matter.
- Consider code quality, **not** compliance with the personal taste.
