title: Team structure
---

## Basics

- The team should have **a flat structure** without any influence of job titles.
- Team members must be able to communicate with each other without any *intermediate participants*.

## Job titles
- All job titles **must be available for viewing** by all team members on an internal portal.
- **Job titles mustn't be recalled in every day work**. Violations of this rule must be supressed, especially in [code review](/code-review/ethics).
