title: Team interaction
---

- What happens in chats, stays in chats. Team members should interact via a task tracker.
- The communication via messengers should be available only for flooding and discussion of corporate events.
- [Job titles](/team/structure) must not matter in discussion. Senior developers must not have priority over junior developers.
- All technical arguments should be taken into account, regardless of who proposed them.
